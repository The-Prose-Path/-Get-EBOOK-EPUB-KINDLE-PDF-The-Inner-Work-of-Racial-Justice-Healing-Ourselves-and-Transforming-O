‚ÄúIlluminates the very heart of social justice and how it might be approached and nurtured through mindfulness practices in community and through the discernment and new degrees of freedom these practices entrain.‚Äù --from the foreword by Jon Kabat-Zinn
 
In a society where unconscious bias, microaggressions, institutionalized racism, and systemic injustices are so deeply ingrained, healing is an ongoing process. When conflict and division are everyday realities, our instincts tell us to close ranks, to find the safety of those like us, and to blame others. This book profoundly shows that in order to

The Inner Work of Racial Justice: Healing Ourselves and Transforming Our Communities Through Mindfulness by Rhonda V. Magee,Jon Kabat-Zinn Book Review

Rating: 1.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Asian American
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020
Review: I was reading this book for some clarity and mindfulness around my ideas about racism. I came across this paragraph and I wanted to return the book for a full refund , "And there are those, typically racialized as Asian, who have been drawn to or have identified with the "model minority" myth, the idea that some racial or cultural groups are inherently superior to others. These individuals may find themselves a part of a larger narrative that seeks to blame those who fail to succeed, and tries to dismiss racism as a false justification for failure". I doubt that there are any Asians in the US who would dismiss racism as a false justification for failure and as the daughter of Japanese Americans interned during the war, I resent the implication.

Title: This book is a healing practice!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2019
Review: Here's what Rhonda Magee has done in this book: 1. She has shared her own experience with living as a black professional in a our culture; 2. She has invited the reader to share his/her experiences of being discounted; 3. In the context of holding Rhonda's and your own experiences in mind, she has suggested doing it in the container of mindfulness where you are holding a space larger than the narrow issue of discrimination. In my own experience with mindfulness or meditation, this practice tends to provide a clearing or "healing" of the feelings and helps the reader (the practitioner) see the wholeness of us all!!

Title: good ideas presented repetitively
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020
Review: I found this book to be helpful, very easy to read, and firmly grounded in the practices of secular vipassana mindfulness (*not* new age - ignore that reviewer) and the sociology of racism in the context of U.S. culture. Most informative were the examples of race stories, and some of the mindfulness practices. The book is perhaps two or three times longer than it needs to be, because the author's writing style is extremely circular and frustratingly repetitive. For example, it was difficult to discern different themes and topics from chapter to chapter, because the message was all the same, stated a hundred different ways. Even the suggested mindfulness practices were extremely similar, and less helpful to readers who are already experienced mindfulness practitioners or facilitators. I think that, with much more vigorous organization and editing, this book could have been (or could be in the second edition?) the go-to resource on this topic.

Title: Not new age - ancient wisdom to face the difficult
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020
Review: This book challenges any reader to examine or re-examine beliefs and perceptions of experience about racial justice. Critically, and truly what sets it apart, it provides specific practices that enable readers to face their own perspectives and beliefs with less reactivity and increase their awareness of the experiences of others and heir own. Magee positions mindfulness as the inner work that may help all of us turn toward the difficult and reach out, or at least not run from, the difficult discussions that are needed to advance racial justice. I expect any reader will, like I did, have negative ‚Äúgut‚Äù reactions to some examples or stories. However, practicing the practices - and it‚Äôs all about the practice - helped me get past my reaction and into reflection. And God knows we could use more of that these days.

Title: Thought provoking, well-written, engaging
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019
Review: I really love this book, it is written in a way that is engaging (lots of stories to help illustrate more abstract points or historical constructs) and thought-provoking. I am constantly thinking about what I've read in this book, and how I can apply it in my life. I also bought it on Audible so that I could listen while in the car, and I love both the audio and written versions.

Title: Important and timely book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2020
Review: This is an excellent book! It's thought-provoking, moving, and inspiring. And it's a timely and important contribution to the national conversation we're all having now, on racism and racial justice. Professor Magee, a longtime law professor, teacher and practitioner of mindfulness meditation, skillfully weaves together many strands, including her own painful experiences of racism, the history of race and racism, insights from science and social science, and mindfulness meditation. She shows how the practice of mindfulness meditation can give us the tools we need to navigate challenging racial issues and make positive changes in ourselves and our communities. I appreciate that she tackles the many complexities of racism, avoiding the simplistic approach that's too often taken.
